# Basic_DNN
An adapted implementation of the MATLAB code provided in the paper 'Deep Learning: An Introduction for Applied Mathematicians' by C. F. Higham and D. J. Higham (https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.05894)


## Notable Functionality Changes:
* arbitrary number of layers with arbitrary number of nodes in each
* choice of activation function including linear, sigmoid, ReLU, leaky ReLU and ELU
* batch stochastic Gradient descent rather than (single sample) stochastic gradient descent

## To-Do Items:
* vectorised version (less 'readable' but quicker to perform experiments)
* adaptive learning rate
